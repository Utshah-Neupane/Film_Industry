<b><u>Aamir and Deepika to team up for 'thug'???</u></b>
<br><br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
YPF's 'Thug' is finally going on floors early next year. After a lot of premutations and
combinations,<br> director Vijay Krishna Acharya seems to have found his cast.

While Hritik Roshan was initially approached to play the lead role,
it is Aamir who has replaced him in the adventure film. Now we hear that 
makers have again approached Deepika Padukone to star as the lead lady.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Why again? Deepika was also offered the film initially but she refused 
to take it up. Victor has reworked on the script and the role of the heroine
to has changed now. Will DP say  yes to this project?
