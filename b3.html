<P> The way movies are made and how they're approached is completely different now than it was six 
decades ago. Earlier only romantic movies were given priority and the movies which
were made also didn't have much powerful and animated scenes whereas nowadays movies with much-more
advanced technology and sophisticated design and performances are released which later results as the king
in box-office.</p>

<p>Recently there has been a revival in 3D film popularity. 3D films have gained increasing popularity 
with the best critical and financial successes being in the field of feature film animation. As of 2010, the
 largest film industries by number of feature films produced are those of India, the United States,
 China, Nigeria and Japan. Beginning in 2008 with Iron Man and The Dark Knight, superhero 
films have greatly increased in popularity and financial success, with films based on Marvel
