The history of film began in the 1890s, when motion picture cameras were invented and
 film production companies started to be established. Because of the limits of technology, 
films of the 1890s were under a minute long and until 1927 motion pictures were produced
 without sound. The first decade of motion picture saw film moving from a novelty to an
 established large-scale entertainment industry. The films became several minutes
 long consisting of several shots. The first rotating camera for taking panning shots
 was built in 1898. The first film studios were built in 1897. Special effects were introduced 
and film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, began to be 
used. In the 1900s, continuity of action across successive shots was achieved.

<p>Most films of this period were what came to be called "chase films". The first use
 of animation in movies was in 1899. The first feature length multi-reel film was a 1906
 Australian production. The first successful permanent theatre showing only films was 
"The Nickelodeon" in Pittsburgh in 1905. By 1910, actors began to receive screen
 credit for their roles, and the way to the creation of film stars was opened. 
Overall, from about 1910, American films had the largest share of the market in
 Australia and in all European countries except France.</p>

<p>The first eleven years of motion pictures show the cinema moving from a novelty to an 
established large-scale entertainment industry. The films represent a movement from films
 consisting of one shot, completely made by one person with a few assistants, towards 
films several minutes long consisting of several shots, which were made by large 
companies in something like industrial conditions.</p>

<p>The year 1900 conveniently marks the emergence of the first motion pictures
 that can be considered as 'films' – at this point, film-makers begin to introduce 
basic editing techniques and film narrative.</p>

<p>With the worldwide film boom, yet more countries now joined Britain, France, 
Germany and the United States in serious film production. In Italy, production was spread 
over several centres, with Turin being the first and biggest. There, Ambrosio was the first
 company in the field in 1905, and remained the largest in the country through this period.
 Its most substantial rival was Cines in Rome, which started producing in 1906. The great strength 
of the Italian industry was historical epics, with large casts and massive scenery. As early as 1911, 
Giovanni Pastrone's two-reel La Caduta di Troia (The Fall of Troy) made a big impression 
worldwide, and it was followed by even bigger spectacles like Quo Vadis? (1912), which ran
 for 90 minutes, and Pastrone's Cabiria of 1914, which ran for two and a half hours.</p>

<p>Slowly and gradually new film techniques were introduced in this period including the use of artificial
lighting, fire effects and Low-key lighting (i.e. lighting in which most of the frame is dark) for enhanced
atmosphere during sinister scenes. Continuity of action from shot to shot was also refined. Another 
development was the use of the Point of View shot, first used in 1910 in Vitagraph's Back to Nature.
 Insert shots were also used for artistic purposes; the Italian film La mala planta (The Evil Plant),
 directed by Mario Caserini had an insert shot of a snake slithering over the ‘Evil Plant’.</p>

<p>As films grew longer, specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories
 derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel. Genres began to be
 used as categories; the main division was into comedy and drama, but these categories were 
further subdivided. Intertitles containing lines of dialogue began to be used consistently from 1908 
onwards.</p>

From 1980s onwards, the film industry reached at the peak of success. The gross production and income
from this field rapidly crossed everyone's imagination, limits and ideology. Film industry of each and every
country started competing with one another which made this sector more precious, amazing and important.
In this race of being the number 1, US leaves each and every countery behind. Since, the origin of film 
industry, the country with most popular, much-more sophisticated, much-more famousand advanced as 
well as highest earning film industry is the USA. The global cinema is centralized over here.
