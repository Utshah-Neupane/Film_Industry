<b><u>Fast and Furious8 to avoid clash with Bahubali?.</u></b>
<font size="6" color="Crimson" face="Times New Roman">

</p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As plans stand today, those backing Baahubali: The Conclusion
 could well be aiming to release the film across 5000+ screens 
across the country as they are looking to make it accessible to
 one and all, from North to South. On the other hand Fast &
 Furious 8 too deserves a record release in India due to its franchise
 power, which means a release across 3000+ screens is a given. 
<br>

<img border="2" src="66.jpg" height="350" width="450"></center>
<br>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It's all happening! With India taking Hollywood a lot more seriously
 than ever before (and vice versa), release dates of biggies are being
 finalized much in advance so as to avoid any clash whatsoever. Well,
 it seems like there is some planning put into place an year in advance, 
what with the date of Fast & Furious 8 being announced as 14th April
 2017. The trouble ahead? Well, inarguably India's biggest and most
 awaited film till date, Baahubali: The Conclusion, is also slated to arrive
 on the same date next year.</p>
</center>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "This is one clash that just can't happen," declares a trade guru, 
"Yes, globally it is Fast & Furious franchise that is hugely popular.
 However, the build up towards Baahubali: The Conclusion too has 
been unparalleled. Part One of the SS Rajamouli film was hugely 
successful and raked in over 500 crore. Even in Hindi, it became 
the first dubbed film to cross the 100 crore mark. On the other hand
 Fast & Furious 7 was the first Hollywood film to enter the 100 crore 
club in India. Both set the records for being the first ever for the Indian
 market and if the two clash, it would be catastrophic."</p>


<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It has happened even before when Hollywood 
films have released earlier to avoid clash with Bollywood biggies.
 Very recently, The Jungle Book released a week earlier so that it 
doesn't have to struggle for screens with Shahrukh Khan's Fan.
 Look how wonderfully well it managed to perform due to this
 strategic decision, and is now on course to cross the 175 crore
 mark. Universal Pictures, which is distributing Fast & Furious 8,
 could well do the same. It would be a win-win situation for all."</p>

<p> With the world wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali, 
guess there isn't an iota of doubt around where the loyalties would
 lie if the two films indeed decide to clash.</p>
