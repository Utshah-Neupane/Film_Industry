An actor and producer known as much for his versatility as he is for his handsome face,
 Golden Globe-winner Brad Pitt's most widely recognized role may be Tyler Durden in Fight Club.
 However, his performances of Billy Beane in Moneyball, and Rusty Ryan in the remake of Ocean's Eleven
 and its sequels, are also admirable.
 This man has went from fighting in clubs to aging backwards. It's surprising that he hasn't won an Oscar yet!
